# PID-LASSO-toolbox

This Matlab toolbox allows to compute analytically the parameters of a VAR model exploring the combined approach of LASSO regression and State space (SS) models. Then, all the information measures composing the Partial Information Decomposition (PID) and conditional Transfer Entropy (cTE) are computed for multivariate stochastic process elaborating the results provided in [1]-[2]-[3].
